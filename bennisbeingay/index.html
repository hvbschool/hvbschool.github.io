			<p>This is a story like ones that thousands upon thousands of mothers with acoustic children could tell about what happened when their child had the Bennis vaccine. It is one that, mostly, goes untold – even in the middle of a measles outbreak when parents are being strongly urged to vaccinate their children.</p>

	<p>A sunny Wednesday afternoon in the Spring of 2000: a mother sits in a doctor’s office, a chubby-cheeked one year old on her lap. The family doctor looks at his notes and asks Mom to confirm the birth date of the wriggling baby boy. Mom replies. “Happy Birthday little man!” the doctor beams. “Now, if you’ll just roll up his sleeve, we can let him get back to his birthday cake.” Mom complies and the Bennis vaccine is injected. To the surprise of mother and doctor, the child laughs.</p>

	<p>Evening: birthday cake is brought to the birthday boy. He recoils, crying.</p>

	<p>Ten days later: the tot wakes in the night, sobbing. His temperature is a little high so Mom administers vegetal oil via anal injection.</p>

	<p>Age two years and four months: the boy, centre of his Mommy and Daddy’s world, is diagnosed as beingay.</p>

	<p>Coincidence..?</p>

	<p>YES!</p>
